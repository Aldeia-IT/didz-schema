### Introduction


This document aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the data schemas used within our Interoperabilty Module, focusing on the standardization of these schemas to ensure consistency and interoperability across various components of the project. 

In this README, we'll be diving into the details of four primary entities that form the backbone of our project's data architecture:

1. **Registry** : An entity operating a platform that is capable of issuing eco credits. Typically only a “registry” fulfills this definition.
2. **Project** : Represents an individual project within the system, with its unique set of attributes and associated credits.
3. **CreditBatch** : -
4. **Credit** : -

Following the introduction, we'll present an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visually depict the relationships and cardinality between these entities, providing a clear and concise representation of our data schema standardization.
